occ - Ojuba Control Center

occ is a program that you can use to control and tune your computer.

if you got a problem with some plugin you may disable it with

  occ --skip-plugins=PLUGIN1,PLUGIN2...

for example if running glxinfo crashes X and thus running occ will send you back to login screen, try this:

  occ --skip-plugins=vga

if you want to run program from the source
    - edit config/org.Ojuba.OCC.service, make Exec key point to occ-mechanism.py in source main directory
    - run make install-dbus-conf as root
